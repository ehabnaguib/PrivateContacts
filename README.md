SecureC is an android mobile application that allows the user to save private phone contacts unlike the default contacts app.
The app has the same main functionality as the default contacts app -even the swipe-to-call- but in addition, no data is shared with any other app and it requires authentication everytime it is opened.
SecureC also adds 2 features not currently in the phone contacts app which is adding Google Maps location of a contact, and open the contact's chat on whatsapp with one click.

SecureC is my own idea, code, and design from scratch.
